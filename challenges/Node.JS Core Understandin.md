# Node.JS Core Understanding

1 What is Node.JS? 

Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking architecture and is known for its speed, scalability, and efficiency. With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, enabling full-stack JavaScript applications. It has a vast ecosystem of modules and libraries available through npm, a package manager. Node.js is commonly used for building web servers, APIs, real-time applications, and command-line tools.
