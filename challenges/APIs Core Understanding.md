# APIs Core Understanding

1. What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to interact and exchange information.

2. What is a Protocol?

A protocol is a set of rules and guidelines that govern the behavior, communication, and interaction between entities in a system or network.

3. Is the term API only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet?

No, the term API (Application Programming Interface) is not only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet. While APIs are commonly associated with web APIs that facilitate communication between software systems over the internet, the concept of an API is broader and not limited to internet-based interactions.

4. Why is structured communication between two programs important?

Structured communication fosters interoperability, modularity, standardization, scalability, error handling, security, and integration, enabling programs to work together efficiently and tap into a wider range of resources and capabilities.

   Do we humans use APIs when communicating without technology?

Yes, humans also use APIs, albeit in a different context, when communicating without technology. In the context of human communication, an API refers to a set of agreed-upon rules, protocols, and conventions that facilitate effective communication between individuals or groups. These rules define the structure, syntax, and semantics of the communication, ensuring that the message is conveyed and understood accurately.

5. Is an API just another program or a standard?

Is not just another program or a standard on its own, but rather a concept that can be implemented and utilized within programs or systems.
