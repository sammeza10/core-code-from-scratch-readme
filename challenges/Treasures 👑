Find the treasure ğŸ‘‘

We are in a room with three chests. We know that at least one has a treasure in it. Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.

a) the middle chest  has a treasure
b) all these chests have treasure
c) only one has a treasure

Since all the messages are lies

a) the middle chest  has a treasure > the middle chest does not have a treasure 
b) all these chests have treasure > all these chests do not have treasure
c) only one has a treasure > only one does not have a treasure

chest that have a treasure is the left and the right chest.
