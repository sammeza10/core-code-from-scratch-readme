calculate the volume of a pyramid, a cube, and a sphere

   1 To calculate the volume of a pyramid:
    a. Measure the length, width, and height of the pyramid.
    b. Multiply the length, width, and height together to get the volume.
    c. Divide the result by 3 to get the final volume.
    d. The final result is the volume of the pyramid.

   2 To calculate the volume of a cube:
    a. Measure the length of one side of the cube.
    b. Multiply the length by itself three times (i.e., cube the length).
    c. The final result is the volume of the cube.

   3 To calculate the volume of a sphere:
    a. Measure the radius of the sphere.
    b. Cube the radius (i.e., multiply it by itself three times).
    c. Multiply the result by 4/3.
    d. Multiply the result by pi (3.141592...).
    e. The final result is the volume of the sphere.
