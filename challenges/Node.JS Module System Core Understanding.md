# Node.JS Module System Core Understanding

1. What is a Javascript Module?

A JavaScript module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functionality and can be exported and imported by other parts of a JavaScript program. Modules help organize and modularize code, making it more maintainable, reusable, and scalable.

2. Why are Javascript Modules necessary?

JavaScript modules provide a structured and modular approach to JavaScript development, making it easier to build, maintain, and scale complex applications while promoting code reuse and collaboration.

3. What module standards are available in Node.JS?

In Node.js, there are primarily two module standards available: CommonJS and ECMAScript (ES) modules.

* CommonJS modules use the require() function to import modules and module.exports or exports to export functionality.

* ES Modules use the import and export keywords to import and export functionality, respectively.

5. What are the differences between ESModules and CommonJS modules?

In summary, ES Modules and CommonJS modules differ in syntax, browser compatibility, loading behavior, default exports, scope, asynchronous behavior, and ecosystem support. The choice between them depends on the target environment, compatibility requirements, and specific needs of the project.

6. Which types of modules exist in Node.JS?

In summary, the types of modules in Node.js include CORE MODULES provided by Node.js itself, LOCAL MODULES created within a project, and THIRD-PARTY MODULES developed by external developers and available through package managers like npm
