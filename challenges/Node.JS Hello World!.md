# Node.JS Hello World!

1. Why do we run the npm init command and not node init to create a new Node.JS project?

The command npm init is used to initialize a new Node.js project, while the command node init does not exist. 

2. When you entered the npm init command and answered the questions you saw in the terminal, a new file called packacke.json was generated.
What does this file do?
Why is this file generated?

The package.json file is generated by running npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. It captures essential project metadata, manages dependencies, defines scripts, and provides a central location for project configuration. This file is crucial for sharing, distributing, collaborating on, and maintaining Node.js projects. It serves as a foundation for proper project management, dependency installation, and execution of project-specific tasks.
