# Logic problem

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?


Solution


Based on the given statements, Bob is the only person who could be telling the truth as his statement that "1 person studied math yesterday" 
is the only one that allows for only one person to be telling the truth. Therefore, the other four students (Alice, Charlie, Dan, and Eva) are lying, 
and only 1 person studied math yesterday.
