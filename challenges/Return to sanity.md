# Return to sanity

### Kata ðŸ¥‹

This function should return an object, but it's not doing what's intended. What's wrong?

    function mystery() {
      var results =
        {sanity: 'Hello'};
      return
        results;
    }


Answer



    function mystery() {
      var results = {sanity: 'Hello'};
      return results;
    }
